# Getting Started with Create React App

This github PR project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`
To ensure necessary packages installed.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `Notes`
This is a pretty silly implement. 
1. UI: I just set up the rebassjs and added a very few styles to the components. I think this is more like a demostration. 
2. Search Function: The seach filter requires to type in the whole word. For example, `Add` or `Fix`.
